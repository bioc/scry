A collection of methods for the analysis of small-count data, such as single-cell RNA-seq.

Including:
 - Deviance for feature selection
 - GLM-PCA for dimension reduction
 - Null residuals, a transformation that when combined with PCA approximates GLM-PCA
 - Quasi-UMI normalization for single-cell read counts
